    <h3>Lifetime</h3>
    <p>
       Created each time they are requested. This lifetime works best for lightweight, stateless services.
    </p>

    <h3>Cases</h3>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>- File Access</li>
            <li>- Database Access</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>
        First Call @Model
    </h4>
    <h3>Second Call @_transient.GetRandomNumber()</h3>

    <p>
        Both numbers are also the same, but the difference is
        that with each refresh of the page, we get a different
        number. The reason for this is that Scoped is initialized
        for each Request (rendering the page and the partial is
        the same request)
    </p>
